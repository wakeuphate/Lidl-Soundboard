# LIDL Soundboard

This project is a simple soundboard that can read .mp3, .wav, and .ogg files through shortcut, and send them to different audio output.

## Getting Started

Those basics instruction will get you started on your way to memeing (read: sniping Forsen).

### Prerequisites

To be able to stream audio in game, you'll need a virtual audio cable software. If you don't have one, you can download one [here](https://www.vb-audio.com/Cable/).


### Launching the soundboard

JUST UNZIP AND LAUNCH THE EXE LOOOOOOOOOOOOOL 4HEad


### Configuration for proper cancer

#### Select main audio output device

Only if you wanna hear your own cancer.

#### Select VAC audio output

To be able to send audio to game. Don't forget to set VAC as the microphone to use in game. (or as the default device in the system).


#### Microphone injection: System driven

If you wanna be able to talk in game while also being able to send sounds, check out the manual.


#### Set push to talk key. 

So that the soundboard hold the game PTT key for you, if you set it accordingly in the settings.

## Planned features
 * Being able to set volume for each sound added in a sound collection.
 * Being able to open recent soundboards, or swap them with a combo box. (will require a settings.json file or smth).
 * Auto-updater (maybe LUL)


## Versioning
 * 1.1.1: Fixed soundboard opening not displaying properly the auto-hold ptt bind and the stop all bind (Would still work, just not being displayed).
 * 1.1.0: Added drag and drop functionnality to the sound edit window.
 * 1.0.0: Everything works forsenE.
 * 0.60: Can now save the soundboard as a json text and open it. 
 	     It will save every thing.
 * 0.50: Everything works. Mic injection will be done by the system as explained in the guide
 * 0.43: Fixed sequential auto not working as intended. Added tooltip to explain what are the modes. Added a bindable pause button.
 * 0.42: Fixed a bug that would shift shortcuts. Key sequence edition should lose focus after setting a shortcut.
 * 0.41: Auto-hold PTT should now be working in every game.
 * 0.4: Shortcuts are now stored as virtual key. So every key should be usable, regardless of keyboard localization.
 * 0.3: Pre-Release. Sound can be played and most of the key are usable as binds.
